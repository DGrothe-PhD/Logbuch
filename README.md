# Logbuch
just a short script to log events with a timestamp

checks.py is the part to generate events. daylogs.txt is the log of your checks.

My usecase:
I want to log events like meals, takeing medicin and so on.

Solution:
Running checks.py, it shows the last logged event [yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss] name.
adding a new event by typing its name.
it adds  the new event to the top of daychecks.txt, so you can look it up later.
